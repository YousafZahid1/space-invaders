## Space Invaders v2
This is me creating a custom version of the arcade game Space Invaders
using Java Swing.
This is done for the final project of 2023-2024 Foundations of Computer Science class.


## Running the Game
Run the following command to install it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YousafZahid1/space-invaders.git
cd space-invaders
```
To run the game, all you need to do is:
```bash
javac src/MainDriver.java && java src/MainDriver

```
